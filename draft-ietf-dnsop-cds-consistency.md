.# Abstract

Maintenance of DNS delegations requires occasional changes of the DS and
NS record sets on the parent side of the delegation.
For the case of DS records, RFC 7344 provides automation by allowing the
child to publish CDS and/or CDNSKEY records holding the prospective DS
parameters which the parent can ingest.
Similarly, RFC 7477 specifies CSYNC records to indicate a desired update
of the delegation's NS (and glue) records.
Parent-side entities (e.g. Registries, Registrars) can query these
records from the child and, after validation, use them to update the
parent-side RRsets of the delegation.

This document specifies that when performing such queries, parent-side
entities MUST ensure that updates triggered via CDS/CDNSKEY and CSYNC
records are consistent across the child's authoritative nameservers,
before taking any action based on these records.

# Introduction

[@!RFC7344] automates DNSSEC delegation trust maintenance by having the
child publish CDS and/or CDNSKEY records which hold the prospective DS
parameters.
Similarly, [@!RFC7477] specifies CSYNC records indicating a desired
update of the delegation's NS and associated glue records.
Parent-side entities (e.g. Registries, Registrars) can use these records
to update the corresponding records of the delegation.

For ingesting CSYNC records, [@!RFC7477] Section 3.1 advocates that
Parental Agents limit queries to just one authoritative nameserver (as
typically done in normal resolution).
The corresponding Section 6.1 of [@!RFC7344] (CDS/CDNSKEY) contains no
provision for how specifically queries for these records should be done.

Retrieving records from just one authoritative server (e.g., by
directing queries towards a trusted validating resolver) works fine when
all is in order.
However, problems may arise if CDS/CDNSKEY/CSYNC record sets are
inconsistent across authoritative nameservers, either because they are
out of sync (e.g., during a KSK rollover), or because they are not
controlled by the same entity (e.g., in a multi-signer setup
[@?RFC8901]).

In such cases, if CDS/CDNSKEY/CSYNC records are retrieved from one
nameserver only ("naively", without a consistency check), each
nameserver can unilaterally trigger an update of the delegation's DS or
NS record set.

For example, a single provider in a multi-signer setup may (accidentally
or maliciously) cause another provider's trust anchors and/or
nameservers to be removed from the delegation.
This can occur both when the multi-signer configuration is temporary
(during a provider change) and when it is permanent (for redundancy).
In any case, a single provider should not be in the position to remove
the other providers' records from the delegation.

Similar breakage can occur when the delegation has lame nameservers,
where an attacker may illegitimately initialize a DS record set and then
manipulate the delegation's NS record set at will.
More detailed examples are given in (#scenarios).

For a CDS/CDNSKEY/CSYNC consumer, it is generally impossible to estimate
the impact of a requested delegation update unless all of the child's
authoritative nameservers are inspected.
At the same time, applying an automated delegation update "MUST NOT
break the current delegation" ([@!RFC7344], Section 4.1), i.e., it MUST
NOT hamper availability or validatability of the Child's resolution.

This document therefore specifies that parent-side entities
MUST ensure that the updates indicated by CDS/CDNSKEY and CSYNC record
sets are consistent across all of the child's authoritative nameservers,
before taking any action based on these records.

Readers are expected to be familiar with DNSSEC, including [@!RFC4033],
[@!RFC4034], [@!RFC4035], [@?RFC6781], [@!RFC7344], [@!RFC7477], and
[@?RFC8901].


## Requirements Notation

The key words "**MUST**", "**MUST NOT**", "**REQUIRED**",
"**SHALL**", "**SHALL NOT**", "**SHOULD**", "**SHOULD NOT**",
"**RECOMMENDED**", "**NOT RECOMMENDED**", "**MAY**", and
"**OPTIONAL**" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
BCP 14 [@!RFC2119] [@!RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
capitals, as shown here.

## Terminology

Multi-provider setup:
: A constellation where several providers independently operate authoritative
  DNS service for a domain, usually for purposes of redundancy. This includes
  setups both with and without DNSSEC.

Multi-signer setup:
: A multi-provider setup for a DNSSEC-enabled domain with multiple independent
  signing entities [@?RFC8901]. Such a setup may be permanent (for redundancy)
  or temporary (for continuity of DNSSEC operation while changing the provider
  of a domain that normally uses a single one).

Otherwise, the terminology in this document is as defined in [@!RFC7344].


# Updates to RFCs

[@!RFC7344] Section 4.1 lists acceptance rules for CDS/CDNSKEY records.
This list is extended with the consistency requirements defined in this
document.

[@!RFC7477] Sections 3.1 and 4.2 have logic for deciding from which
nameserver to query CSYNC information. This logic is replaced with the
CSYNC consistency requirements defined in this document.


# Processing Requirements

Consistency requirements that apply equally to CDS/CDNSKEY and CSYNC are
listed first; type-specific consistency criteria are described in
separate subsections.

In all cases, consistency is REQUIRED across received responses only.
(A NODATA response is a received response.)

When a response cannot be obtained from a given nameserver, the Parental
Agent SHOULD attempt to obtain it at a later time, before concluding
that the nameserver is permanently unreachable and removing it from
consideration.
A retry schedule with exponential back-off is RECOMMENDED (such as after
5, 10, 20, 40, ... minutes).
To sidestep localized routing issues, the Parental Agent MAY also
attempt contacting the nameserver from another vantage point.

If an inconsistent state is encountered, the Parental Agent MUST abort
the operation.
Specifically, it MUST NOT delete or alter any existing RRset that would
have been deleted or altered, and MUST NOT create any RRsets that would
have been created, had the nameservers given consistent responses.

To accommodate transient inconsistencies (e.g. replication delays), the
Parental Agent MAY retry the full process, repeating all queries.
A schedule with exponential back-off is RECOMMENDED.

Any pending queries can immediately be dequeued when encountering a
response that confirms the status quo, either implicitly (NODATA) or
explicitly.
This is because any subsequent responses could only confirm that nothing
needs to happen, or give an inconsistent result in which case nothing
needs to happen.
Queries MAY be continued across all nameservers for reporting purposes.

Existing requirements for ensuring integrity remain in effect.
In particular, DNSSEC signatures MUST be requested and validated for all
queries unless otherwise noted.


## CDS and CDNSKEY

To retrieve a Child's CDS/CDNSKEY RRset for DNSSEC delegation trust
maintenance, the Parental Agent, knowing both the Child zone name and
its NS hostnames, MUST ascertain that queries are made against all
(reachable) nameservers listed in the Child's delegation from the
Parent, and ensure that each key referenced in any of the received
answers is also referenced in all other received responses.

In other words, CDS/CDNSKEY records at the Child zone apex MUST be
fetched directly from each (reachable) authoritative server as
determined by the delegation's NS record set.
When a key is referenced in a CDS or CDNSKEY record set returned by
one nameserver, but is missing from a least one other nameserver's
answer, the CDS/CDNSKEY state MUST be considered inconsistent.

During initial DS provisioning (DNSSEC bootstrapping), conventional
DNSSEC validation for CDS/CDNSKEY responses is not (yet) available; in
this case, authenticated bootstrapping ([@!RFC9615]) should be used.


## CSYNC

A CSYNC-based workflow generally consists of (1) querying the CSYNC (and
possibly SOA) record to determine which data records shall be synchronized from
child to parent, and (2) querying for these data records (e.g. NS), before
placing them in the parent zone.
If the below conditions are not met during these steps, the CSYNC state
MUST be considered inconsistent.

When querying the CSYNC record, the Parental Agent MUST ascertain that
queries are made against all (reachable) nameservers listed in the
Child's delegation from the Parent, and ensure that the record's
immediate flag and type bitmap are equal across received responses.

The CSYNC record's SOA serial field and soaminimum flag might
legitimately differ across nameservers (such as in multi-provider
setups); equality is thus not required across responses.
Instead, for a given response, processing of these values MUST
occur with respect to the SOA record as obtained from the same
nameserver (preferably in the same connection).
If the resulting per-nameserver assessments of whether the update is
permissible do not all agree, the CSYNC state MUST be considered
inconsistent.

Further, when retrieving the data record sets as indicated in the CSYNC
record (such as NS or A/AAAA records), the Parental Agent MUST ascertain
that all queries are made against all (reachable) nameservers listed in
the delegation, and ensure that all return responses with equal rdata
sets (including all empty).

Other CSYNC processing rules from [@!RFC7477] Section 3 remain in place without
modification. For example, when the NS type flag is present, associated NS
processing has to occur before potential glue updates to ensure that glue
addresses match the right set of nameservers.
Also, when the type bitmap contains the A/AAAA flags, corresponding address
queries are only to be sent for NS hostnames "that are in bailiwick", while
out-of-bailiwick NS records are ignored.
For details, see [@!RFC7477] Sections 3.2.2 and Section 4.3.

CSYNC-based updates may cause validation or even insecure resolution to break
(e.g. by changing the delegation to a set of nameservers that do not
serve required DNSKEY records or do not know the zone at all).
Parental Agents SHOULD check that CSYNC-based updates, if applied, do not
break the delegation.


# IANA Considerations

This document has no IANA actions.


# Security Considerations

The level of rigor mandated by this document is needed to prevent
publication of half-baked DS or delegation NS RRsets (authorized only
under an insufficient subset of authoritative nameservers), ensuring
that a single operator cannot unilaterally modify the delegation (add or
remove trust anchors or nameservers) when other operators are present.
This applies both when the setup is intentional and when it is
unintentional (such as in the case of lame delegation hijacking).

As a consequence, the delegation's records can only be modified when
zonefiles are synchronized across operators, unanimously reflecting the
domain owner's intentions.
Both availability and integrity of the domain's DNS service benefit from
this policy.

In order to resolve situations in which consensus about child zone
contents cannot be reached (e.g. because one of the nameserver
operators is uncooperative), Parental Agents SHOULD continue to accept
DS and NS/glue update requests from the domain owner via an
authenticated out-of-band channel (such as EPP [@!RFC5730]),
irrespective of the adoption of automated delegation maintenance.
Availability of such an interface also enables recovery from a situation
where the private key is no longer available for signing the CDS/CDNSKEY
or CSYNC records in the child zone.

{#scenarios}
# Failure Scenarios

The following scenarios are examples of how things can go wrong when
consistency is not enforced by the parent during CDS/CDNSKEY/CSYNC
processing.
Other scenarios that cause similar (or perhaps even more) harm may
exist.

The common feature of these scenarios is that if one nameserver steps
out of line and the parent is not careful, DNS resolution and/or
validation will break down. When several DNS providers are involved,
this undermines the very guarantees of operator independence that
multi-provider configurations are intended to provide.

## DS Breakage due to Replication Lag

If an authoritative nameserver is lagging behind during a key rollover,
the parent may see different CDS/CDNSKEY RRsets depending on the
nameserver contacted. This may cause old and new DS RRsets to be
deployed in an alternating fashion. The zone maintainer, having detected
that the DS deployment was successful, may then confidently remove the
old DNSKEY from the zonefile, only to find out later that the DS RRset
has been turned back, breaking the delegation's DNSSEC chain of trust.

Checking for consistency minimizes this risk. In case the parent reports
consistency errors downstream, it can also help detect the replication
issue on the child side.


## Escalation of Lame Delegation Takeover

A delegation may include a non-existent NS hostname, for example due to
a typo or when the nameserver's domain registration has expired.
(Re-)registering such a non-resolvable nameserver domain allows a third
party to run authoritative DNS service for all domains delegated to that
NS hostname, serving responses different from those in the legitimate
zonefile.

This strategy for hijacking (at least part of the) DNS traffic and
spoofing responses is not new, but surprisingly common [@?LAME1;@LAME2].
It is also known that DNSSEC reduces the impact of such an attack,
as validating resolvers will reject illegitimate responses due to lack
of signatures consistent with the delegation's DS records.

On the other hand, if the delegation is not protected by DNSSEC, the
rogue nameserver is not only able to serve unauthorized responses
without detection; it is even possible for the attacker to escalate the
nameserver takeover to a full domain takeover.

In particular, the rogue nameserver can publish CDS/CDNSKEY records.
If those are processed by the parent without ensuring consistency with
other authoritative nameservers, the delegation will, with some patience, get
secured with the attacker's DNSSEC keys. Of course, as the parent‚Äôs query (or
sometimes queries) need to hit the attacker's nameserver, this requires some
statistical luck; but eventually it will succeed.
As responses served by the remaining legitimate nameservers are not
signed with these keys, validating resolvers will start rejecting them.

Once DNSSEC is established, the attacker can use CSYNC to remove other
nameservers from the delegation at will (and potentially add new ones
under their control), or change glue records to point to the attacker's
nameservers.
This enables the attacker to position themself as the only party
providing authoritiative DNS service for the victim domain,
significantly augmenting the attack's impact.


## Multi-Provider (Permanent Multi-Signer)

### DS Breakage

While performing a key rollover and adjusting the corresponding
CDS/CDNSKEY records, a provider could accidentally publish CDS/CDNSKEY
records that only include its own keys.

When the parent happens to retrieve the records from a nameserver
controlled by this provider, the other providers' DS records would be
removed from the delegation.
As a result, the zone is broken at least for some queries.

### NS Breakage

A similar scenario affects the CSYNC record, which is used to update the
delegation's NS record set at the parent.
The issue occurs, for example, when a provider accidentally includes
only their own set of hostnames in the local NS record set, or publishes
an otherwise flawed NS record set.

If the parent then observes a CSYNC signal and fetches the flawed NS
record set without ensuring consistency across nameservers, the
delegation may be updated in a way that breaks resolution or silently
reduces the multi-provider setup to a single-provider setup.

## Bogus Provider Change (Temporary Multi-Signer)

Transferring DNS service for a domain name from one (signing) DNS
provider to another, without going insecure, necessitates a brief period
during which the domain is operated in multi-signer mode:
First, the providers include each other's signing keys as DNSKEY and
CDS/CDNSKEY records in their copy of the zone.
Once the parent learns about the updated CDS/CDNSKEY record set at the
old provider, the delegation's DS record set is updated.
Then, after waiting for cache expiration, the new provider's NS
hostnames can be added to the zone's NS record set, so that queries
start balancing across both providers.
(To conclude the hand-over, the old provider is removed by inverting
these steps with swapped roles.)

The multi-signer phase of this process breaks when the new provider,
perhaps unaware of the situation and its intricacies, fails to include
the old provider's keys in the DNSKEY (and CDS/CDNSKEY) record sets.
One obvious consequence of that is that whenever the resolver happens to
retrieve the DNSKEY record set from the new provider, the old provider's
RRSIGs do no longer validate, causing SERVFAIL to be returned.

However, an even worse consequence can occur when the parent performs
their next CDS/CDNSKEY scan:
It may then happen that the incorrect CDS/CDNSKEY record set is fetched
from the new provider and used to update the delegation's DS record set.
As a result, the old provider (who still appears in the delegation) is
prematurely removed from the domain's DNSSEC chain of trust.
The new DS record set authenticates the new provider's DNSKEYs only, and
DNSSEC validation fails for all answers served by the old provider.
