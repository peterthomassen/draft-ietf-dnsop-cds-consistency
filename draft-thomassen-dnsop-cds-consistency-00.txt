             Ensuring CDS/CDNSKEY Consistency is Mandatory
                draft-thomassen-dnsop-cds-consistency-00

Abstract

   For maintaining DNSSEC Delegation Trust, DS records have to be kept
   up to date.  [RFC7344] automates this by having the child publish CDS
   and/or CDNSKEY records which hold the prospective DS parameters.
   Parent-side entities (e.g.  Registries, Registrars) can use these
   records to update the delegation's DS records.  A common method for
   detecting changes in CDS/CDNSKEY record sets is to query them
   periodically from the child zone ("polling"), as described in
   Section 6.1 of [RFC7344].

   This document specifies that if polling is used, parent-side entities
   MUST ensure that CDS/CDNSKEY record sets are equivalent across all of
   the child's authoritative nameservers, before taking any action based
   on these records.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC7344] automates DNSSEC delegation trust maintenance by having the
   child publish CDS and/or CDNSKEY records which hold the prospective
   DS parameters.  Parent-side entities (e.g.  Registries, Registrars)
   can use these records to update the delegation's DS records.  A
   common method for detecting changes in CDS/CDNSKEY record sets is to
   query them periodically from the child zone ("polling"), as described
   in Section 6.1 of [RFC7344].

   While [RFC7344] does specify acceptance rules (Section 4.1 ) for CDS/
   CDNSKEY records that have been retrieved, it does not mention how
   specifically the poll queries should be done.  A naive implementation
   would thus be likely to simply query CDS or CDNSKEY records through a
   trusted validating resolver, and use the validated answer.

   This may be fine if all authoritative nameservers are controlled by
   the same entity (= DNS operator).  However, it poses a problem in
   conjunction with multi-signer setups ([RFC8901]): When the CDS/
   CDNSKEY are retrieved "normally" using a validating resolver, chances
   are that records are retrieved from one nameserver only, without
   checking for consistency across other NS hostnames.

   In a multi-signer setup, this means that a single provider could
   (accidentally or maliciously) roll the DS record set at the parent.
   For example, a provider could be performing a key rollover and then
   accidentally publish CDS/CDNSKEY records for its own keys.  As a
   result, when the parent happens to retrieve the records from a
   nameserver controlled by this provider, the other providers' DS
   records would be removed from the parent, breaking the zone for some
   or all queries.

   A single provider should not be in the position to remove the other
   providers' trust anchors.  To address this issue, this document
   specifies that if polling is used, parent-side entities MUST ensure
   that CDS/CDNSKEY record sets are equivalent across all of the child's
   authoritative nameservers, before taking any action based on these
   records.

   Readers are expected to be familiar with DNSSEC, including [RFC4033],
   [RFC4034], [RFC4035], [RFC6781], [RFC7344], and [RFC8901].

1.1.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Polling a CDS or CDNSKEY Record Set

   The terminology in this section is as defined in [RFC7344].

   To retrieve a Child's CDS/CDNSKEY RRset for DNSSEC delegation trust
   maintenance, the Parental Agent, knowing both the Child zone name and
   its NS hostnames, MUST ascertain that queries are made against all of
   the nameservers listed in the Child's delegation from the Parent, and
   ensure that the set of referenced keys is equal.

   In other words, CDS/CDNSKEY records at the Child zone apex MUST be
   queried directly from each of the authoritative servers as determined
   by the delegation's NS record set, with DNSSEC validation enforced.
   When a key is referenced in the CDS or CDNSKEY record set returned by
   one nameserver, but not referenced in the corresponding answers of
   all of the other nameservers, the CDS/CDNSKEY state MUST be
   considered inconsistent.

   If an inconsistent CDS/CDNSKEY state is encountered, the Parental
   Agent MUST take no action.  Specifically, it MUST NOT delete or alter
   the existing DS RRset.

3.  Security Considerations

   The level of rigor mandated by this document is needed to prevent
   publication of a half-baked DS RRset (authorized only under a subset
   of NS hostnames).  This ensures, for example, that an operator in a
   multi-homed setup cannot unilaterally remove another operator's trust
   anchor from the delegation's DS records.

   As a consequence, DS records can only be modified when there is
   consensus across all operators.
