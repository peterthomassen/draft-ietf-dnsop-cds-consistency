           Consistency for CDS/CDNSKEY and CSYNC is Mandatory
                draft-thomassen-dnsop-cds-consistency-03

Abstract

   Maintenance of DNS delegations requires occasional changes of the DS
   and NS record sets on the parent side of the delegation.  [RFC7344]
   automates this for DS records by having the child publish CDS and/or
   CDNSKEY records which hold the prospective DS parameters.  Similarly,
   CSYNC records indicate a desired update of the delegation's NS
   records [RFC7477].  Parent-side entities (e.g.  Registries,
   Registrars) typically discover these records by periodically querying
   them from the child ("polling"), before using them to update the
   delegation's parameters.

   This document specifies that if polling is used, parent-side entities
   MUST ensure that updates triggered via CDS/CDNSKEY and CSYNC records
   are consistent across the child's authoritative nameservers, before
   taking any action based on these records.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC7344] automates DNSSEC delegation trust maintenance by having the
   child publish CDS and/or CDNSKEY records which hold the prospective
   DS parameters.  Similarly, [RFC7477] specifies CSYNC records
   indicating a desired update of the delegation's NS records.  Parent-
   side entities (e.g.  Registries, Registrars) can use these records to
   update the delegation's DS and NS records.

   A common method for discovering these signals is to periodically
   query them from the child zone ("polling").  For CSYNC, this is
   described in [RFC7477] Section 3.1 which advocates limiting polling
   queries to just one authoritative nameserver.  The corresponding
   Section 6.1 of [RFC7344] (CDS/CDNSKEY) contains no such provision for
   how specifically polling of these records should be done.

   Implementations are thus likely to retrieve records from just one
   authoritative server, typically by directing queries towards a
   trusted validating resolver.  This may be fine if all authoritative
   nameservers are controlled by the same entity (typically the Child

   DNS Operator).  However, it poses a problem in conjunction with the
   multi-signer scenarios laid out in [RFC8901], both when deployed
   temporarily (during a provider change) or permanently (in a multi-
   homing setup).

   CDS/CDNSKEY/CSYNC records retrieved "naively" from one nameserver
   only may be entirely inconsistent with those of other authoritative
   servers.  When several providers are configured and no consistency
   check is done, a single provider could (accidentally or maliciously)
   roll the DS or NS record set at the parent and, for example, remove
   the other provider's trust anchors and/or nameservers from the
   delegation.  More detailed examples are given in Section 2.

   Whether in a permanent multi-homing setup or during provider change:
   A single provider should not be in the position to remove the other
   providers' records from the delegation.

   To address this issue, this document specifies that if polling is
   used, parent-side entities MUST ensure that the updates indicated by
   CDS/CDNSKEY and CSYNC record sets are consistent across all of the
   child's authoritative nameservers, before taking any action based on
   these records.

   Readers are expected to be familiar with DNSSEC, including [RFC4033],
   [RFC4034], [RFC4035], [RFC6781], [RFC7344], [RFC7477], and [RFC8901].

1.1.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.2.  Terminology

   The terminology in this document is as defined in [RFC7344].

2.  Failure Scenarios

   The following scenarios are examples of how things can go wrong when
   consistency is not enforced by the parent during CDS/CDNSKEY/CSYNC
   processing.  Other scenarios that cause similar (or perhaps even
   more) harm may exist.







Thomassen               Expires 5 September 2023                [Page 3]

   The common feature of these scenarios is that if one DNS provider
   makes a mistake and the parent is not careful, DNS resolution and/or
   validation will break down, undermining the very guarantees of
   operator independence that DNS multi-homing setups are intended to
   provide.

2.1.  Multi-Homing (Permanent Multi-Signer)

2.1.1.  DS Breakage

   While performing a key rollover and adjusting the corresponding CDS/
   CDNSKEY records, a provider could accidentally publish CDS/CDNSKEY
   records that only include its own keys.

   When the parent happens to retrieve the records from a nameserver
   controlled by this provider, the other providers' DS records would be
   removed from the delegation.  As a result, the zone is broken at
   least for some queries.

2.1.2.  NS Breakage

   A similar scenario affects the CSYNC record, which is used to update
   the delegation's NS record set at the parent.  The issue occurs, for
   example, when a provider accidentally includes only their own set of
   hostnames in the local NS record set, or publishes an otherwise
   flawed NS record set.

   If the parent then observes a CSYNC signal and fetches the flawed NS
   record set without ensuring consistency across nameservers, the
   delegation may be updated in a way that breaks resolution or silently
   reduces the multi-homing setup to a single-provider setup.

2.2.  Provider Change (Temporary Multi-Signer)

   Transferring DNS service for a domain name from one (signing) DNS
   provider to another, without going insecure, necessitates a brief
   period during which the domain is operated in multi-signer mode:
   First, the providers include each other's signing keys as DNSKEY and
   CDS/CDNSKEY records in their copy of the zone.  Once the parent
   detects the updated CDS/CDNSKEY record set at the old provider, the
   delegation's DS record set is updated.  Then, after waiting for cache
   expiration, the new provider's NS hostnames can be added to the
   zone's NS record set, so that queries start balancing across both
   providers.  (To conclude the hand-over, the old provider is removed
   by inverting these steps with swapped roles.)

Internet-Draft               cds-consistency                  March 2023


   The multi-signer phase of this process breaks when the new provider
   fails to include the old provider's keys in the DNSKEY and CDS/
   CDNSKEY record sets.  One obvious consequence of that is that
   whenever the resolver happens to retrieve the DNSKEY record set from
   the new provider, the old provider's RRSIGs do no longer validate,
   causing responses to SERVFAIL.

   However, an even worse consequence can occur when the parent performs
   their next CDS/CDNSKEY scan: It may then happen that the incorrect
   CDS/CDNSKEY record set is fetched from the new provider and used to
   update the delegation's DS record set.  As a result, the old provider
   is prematureley removed from the domain's DNSSEC chain of trust.  The
   new DS record set authenticates the new provider's DNSKEYs only, and
   DNSSEC validation fails for all answers served by the old provider.

3.  Polling Requirements

   This section defines consistency requirements for poll-based updates,
   updating [RFC7344] Section 4.1 and [RFC7477] Sections 3.1 and 4.2.
   Common ones are listed first, with type-specific criteria for polling
   consistency described in each subsection.

   In all cases, consistency is REQUIRED across received responses only.
   Nameservers that appear to be unavailable SHOULD be disregarded as if
   they were not part of the NS record set.

   If an inconsistent polling state is encountered, the Parental Agent
   MUST take no action.  Specifically, it MUST NOT delete or alter any
   existing RRset that would have been deleted or altered, had the
   polling state been consistent.

   To accommodate transient inconsistencies (e.g. replication delays),
   the Parental Agent MAY retry the full process, repeating all queries.
   A schedule with exponential back-off is RECOMMENDED (such as after 5,
   10, 20, 40, ... minutes).

3.1.  CDS and CDNSKEY

   To retrieve a Child's CDS/CDNSKEY RRset for DNSSEC delegation trust
   maintenance, the Parental Agent, knowing both the Child zone name and
   its NS hostnames, MUST ascertain that queries are made against all of
   the nameservers listed in the Child's delegation from the Parent, and
   ensure that each key referenced in any of the received answers is
   also referenced in all other received responses.

   In other words, CDS/CDNSKEY records at the Child zone apex MUST be
   fetched directly from each of the authoritative servers as determined
   by the delegation's NS record set, with DNSSEC validation enforced.

Internet-Draft               cds-consistency                  March 2023


   When a key is referenced in a CDS or CDNSKEY record set returned by
   one nameserver, but is missing from a least one other nameserver's
   answer, the CDS/CDNSKEY polling state MUST be considered
   inconsistent.

3.2.  CSYNC

   A CSYNC-based update consists of (1) polling the CSYNC record to
   determine which data records shall be synchronized from child to
   parent; (2) querying for these data records (e.g.  NS) and placing
   them in the parent zone.  If the below conditions are not met during
   these steps, the CSYNC polling state MUST be considered inconsistent.

   When polling the CYSNC record set, the Parental Agent MUST ascertain
   that queries are made against all of the nameservers listed in the
   Child's delegation from the Parent, and ensure that the CSYNC record
   sets are equal across all received responses.

   When retrieving data record sets (e.g.  NS), the Parental Agent MUST
   ascertain that all queries are made against all of the nameservers
   listed in the Child's delegation from the Parent, and ensure that the
   record sets are all equal (including all empty).

4.  Security Considerations

   The level of rigor mandated by this document is needed to prevent
   publication of half-baked DS or delegation NS RRsets (authorized only
   under an insufficient subset of authoritative nameservers), and
   ensures that an operator in a multi-homing setup cannot unilaterally
   modify the delegation (add or remove trust anchors or nameservers).

   As a consequence, the delegation's records can only be modified when
   there is consensus across operators.
