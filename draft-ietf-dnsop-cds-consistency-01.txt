           Consistency for CDS/CDNSKEY and CSYNC is Mandatory
                  draft-ietf-dnsop-cds-consistency-01

Abstract

   Maintenance of DNS delegations requires occasional changes of the DS
   and NS record sets on the parent side of the delegation.  [RFC7344]
   automates this for DS records by having the child publish CDS and/or
   CDNSKEY records which hold the prospective DS parameters.  Similarly,
   CSYNC records indicate a desired update of the delegation's NS
   records [RFC7477].  Parent-side entities (e.g.  Registries,
   Registrars) typically discover these records by querying them from
   the child, and then use them to update the delegation's DS RRset
   accordingly.

   This document specifies that when performing such queries, parent-
   side entities MUST ensure that updates triggered via CDS/CDNSKEY and
   CSYNC records are consistent across the child's authoritative
   nameservers, before taking any action based on these records.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC7344] automates DNSSEC delegation trust maintenance by having the
   child publish CDS and/or CDNSKEY records which hold the prospective
   DS parameters.  Similarly, [RFC7477] specifies CSYNC records
   indicating a desired update of the delegation's NS records.  Parent-
   side entities (e.g.  Registries, Registrars) can use these records to
   update the delegation's DS and NS records.

   A common method for discovering these signals is to periodically
   query them from the child zone ("polling").  For CSYNC, this is
   described in [RFC7477] Section 3.1 which advocates limiting queries
   to just one authoritative nameserver.  The corresponding Section 6.1
   of [RFC7344] (CDS/CDNSKEY) contains no such provision for how
   specifically polling of these records should be done.

   Implementations are thus likely to retrieve records from just one
   authoritative server, typically by directing queries towards a
   trusted validating resolver.  While that may be fine if all
   authoritative nameservers are controlled by the same entity
   (typically the Child DNS Operator), it does pose a problem as soon as
   multiple providers are involved.  (Note that it is generally
   impossible for the parent to determine whether all authoritative
   nameservers are controlled by the same entity.)

   In such cases, CDS/CDNSKEY/CSYNC records retrieved "naively" from one
   nameserver only may be entirely inconsistent with those of other
   authoritative servers.  When no consistency check is done, each
   provider may unilaterally trigger a roll of the DS or NS record set
   at the parent.

   As a result, adverse consequences can arise in conjunction with the
   multi-signer scenarios laid out in [RFC8901], both when deployed
   temporarily (during a provider change) and permanently (in a multi-
   homing setup).  For example, a single provider may (accidentally or
   maliciously) cause another provider's trust anchors and/or
   nameservers to be removed from the delegation.  Similar breakage can
   occur when the delegation has lame nameservers.  More detailed
   examples are given in Appendix A.

   A single provider should not be in the position to remove the other
   providers' records from the delegation.  To address this issue, this
   document specifies that parent-side entities MUST ensure that the
   updates indicated by CDS/CDNSKEY and CSYNC record sets are consistent
   across all of the child's authoritative nameservers, before taking
   any action based on these records.

   Readers are expected to be familiar with DNSSEC, including [RFC4033],
   [RFC4034], [RFC4035], [RFC6781], [RFC7344], [RFC7477], and [RFC8901].

2.  Processing Requirements

   This section defines consistency requirements for CDS/CDNSKEY/CSYNC
   queries in the context of automatic delegation maintenance, updating
   [RFC7344] Section 4.1 and [RFC7477] Sections 3.1 and 4.2.  Common
   ones are listed first, with type-specific consistency criteria
   described in each subsection.

   In all cases, consistency is REQUIRED across received responses only.
   Nameservers that appear to be unavailable SHOULD be disregarded as if
   they were not part of the NS record set.

   If an inconsistent state is encountered, the Parental Agent MUST take
   no action.  Specifically, it MUST NOT delete or alter any existing
   RRset that would have been deleted or altered, had the state been
   consistent.

   To accommodate transient inconsistencies (e.g. replication delays),
   the Parental Agent MAY retry the full process, repeating all queries.
   A schedule with exponential back-off is RECOMMENDED (such as after 5,
   10, 20, 40, ... minutes).

2.1.  CDS and CDNSKEY

   To retrieve a Child's CDS/CDNSKEY RRset for DNSSEC delegation trust
   maintenance, the Parental Agent, knowing both the Child zone name and
   its NS hostnames, MUST ascertain that queries are made against all of
   the nameservers listed in the Child's delegation from the Parent, and
   ensure that each key referenced in any of the received answers is
   also referenced in all other received responses.

   In other words, CDS/CDNSKEY records at the Child zone apex MUST be
   fetched directly from each of the authoritative servers as determined
   by the delegation's NS record set, with DNSSEC validation enforced.
   When a key is referenced in a CDS or CDNSKEY record set returned by
   one nameserver, but is missing from a least one other nameserver's
   answer, the CDS/CDNSKEY state MUST be considered inconsistent.

2.2.  CSYNC

   A CSYNC-based update consists of (1) querying the CSYNC record to
   determine which data records shall be synchronized from child to
   parent; (2) querying for these data records (e.g.  NS) and placing
   them in the parent zone.  If the below conditions are not met during
   these steps, the CSYNC state MUST be considered inconsistent.

Internet-Draft               cds-consistency                   June 2023


   When querying the CYSNC record set, the Parental Agent MUST ascertain
   that queries are made against all of the nameservers listed in the
   Child's delegation from the Parent, and ensure that the CSYNC record
   sets are equal across all received responses.

   When retrieving data record sets (e.g.  NS), the Parental Agent MUST
   ascertain that all queries are made against all of the nameservers
   listed in the Child's delegation from the Parent, and ensure that the
   record sets are all equal (including all empty).

3.  Security Considerations

   The level of rigor mandated by this document is needed to prevent
   publication of half-baked DS or delegation NS RRsets (authorized only
   under an insufficient subset of authoritative nameservers), ensuring
   that an operator in a multi-homing setup cannot unilaterally modify
   the delegation (add or remove trust anchors or nameservers).  This
   applies both to intentional and unintentional multi-homing setups
   (such as in the case of lame delegation hijacking).

   As a consequence, the delegation's records can only be modified when
   there is consensus across operators, which is expected to reflect the
   domain owner's intentions.  Both availability and integrity of the
   domain's DNS service benefit from this policy.

   In order to resolve situations in which consensus about child zone
   contents cannot be reached (e.g. because one of the nameserver
   providers is uncooperative), Parental Agents SHOULD continue to
   accept DS and NS update requests from the domain owner via an
   authenticated out-of-band channel (such as EPP [RFC5730]),
   irrespective of the rise of automated delegation maintenance.

Appendix A.  Failure Scenarios

   The following scenarios are examples of how things can go wrong when
   consistency is not enforced by the parent during CDS/CDNSKEY/CSYNC
   processing.  Other scenarios that cause similar (or perhaps even
   more) harm may exist.

   The common feature of these scenarios is that if one DNS provider
   steps out of line and the parent is not careful, DNS resolution and/
   or validation will break down, undermining the very guarantees of
   operator independence that multi-homing configurations are expected
   to provide.

A.1.  Lame Delegations

   A delegation may include a non-existent NS hostname, for example due
   to a typo or when the nameserver's domain registration has expired.
   (Re-)registering such a non-resolvable nameserver domain allows a
   third party to run authoritative DNS service for all domains
   delegated to that NS hostname, serving responses different from those
   in the legitimate zonefile.

   This strategy for hijacking (at least part of the) DNS traffic and
   spoofing responses is not new, but surprisingly common
   [LAME1][LAME2].  It is also known that DNSSEC reduces the impact of
   such an attack, as validating resolvers will reject illegitimate
   responses due to lack of signatures consistent with the delegation's
   DS records.

   On the other hand, if the delegation is not protected by DNSSEC, the
   rogue nameserver is not only able to serve unauthorized responses
   without detection; it is even possible for the attacker to escalate
   the nameserver takeover to a full domain takeover.

   In particular, the rogue nameserver can publish CDS/CDNSKEY records.
   If those are processed by the parent without ensuring consistency
   with other authoritative nameservers, the delegation will be secured
   with the attacker's DNSSEC keys.  As responses served by the
   remaining legitimate nameservers are not signed with these keys,
   validating resolvers will start rejecting them.

   Once DNSSEC is established, the attacker can use CSYNC to remove
   other nameservers from the delegation at will (and potentially add
   new ones under their control).  This enables the attacker to position
   themself as the only party providing authoritiative DNS service for
   the victim domain, significantly augmenting the attack's impact.

A.2.  Multi-Homing (Permanent Multi-Signer)

A.2.1.  DS Breakage

   While performing a key rollover and adjusting the corresponding CDS/
   CDNSKEY records, a provider could accidentally publish CDS/CDNSKEY
   records that only include its own keys.

   When the parent happens to retrieve the records from a nameserver
   controlled by this provider, the other providers' DS records would be
   removed from the delegation.  As a result, the zone is broken at
   least for some queries.

A.2.2.  NS Breakage

   A similar scenario affects the CSYNC record, which is used to update
   the delegation's NS record set at the parent.  The issue occurs, for
   example, when a provider accidentally includes only their own set of
   hostnames in the local NS record set, or publishes an otherwise
   flawed NS record set.

   If the parent then observes a CSYNC signal and fetches the flawed NS
   record set without ensuring consistency across nameservers, the
   delegation may be updated in a way that breaks resolution or silently
   reduces the multi-homing setup to a single-provider setup.

A.3.  Provider Change (Temporary Multi-Signer)

   Transferring DNS service for a domain name from one (signing) DNS
   provider to another, without going insecure, necessitates a brief
   period during which the domain is operated in multi-signer mode:
   First, the providers include each other's signing keys as DNSKEY and
   CDS/CDNSKEY records in their copy of the zone.  Once the parent
   detects the updated CDS/CDNSKEY record set at the old provider, the
   delegation's DS record set is updated.  Then, after waiting for cache
   expiration, the new provider's NS hostnames can be added to the
   zone's NS record set, so that queries start balancing across both
   providers.  (To conclude the hand-over, the old provider is removed
   by inverting these steps with swapped roles.)

   The multi-signer phase of this process breaks when the new provider,
   perhaps unaware of the situation and its intricacies, fails to
   include the old provider's keys in the DNSKEY (and CDS/CDNSKEY)
   record sets.  One obvious consequence of that is that whenever the
   resolver happens to retrieve the DNSKEY record set from the new
   provider, the old provider's RRSIGs do no longer validate, causing
   SERVFAIL to be returned.

   However, an even worse consequence can occur when the parent performs
   their next CDS/CDNSKEY scan: It may then happen that the incorrect
   CDS/CDNSKEY record set is fetched from the new provider and used to
   update the delegation's DS record set.  As a result, the old provider
   (who still appears in the delegation) is prematurely removed from the
   domain's DNSSEC chain of trust.  The new DS record set authenticates
   the new provider's DNSKEYs only, and DNSSEC validation fails for all
   answers served by the old provider.
