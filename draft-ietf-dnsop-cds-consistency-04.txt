           Consistency for CDS/CDNSKEY and CSYNC is Mandatory
                  draft-ietf-dnsop-cds-consistency-04

Abstract

   Maintenance of DNS delegations requires occasional changes of the DS
   and NS record sets on the parent side of the delegation.  RFC 7344
   automates this for DS records by having the child publish CDS and/or
   CDNSKEY records which hold the prospective DS parameters.  Similarly,
   RFC 7477 specifies CSYNC records to indicate a desired update of the
   delegation's NS (and glue) records.  Parent-side entities (e.g.
   Registries, Registrars) typically discover these records by querying
   them from the child, and then use them to update the delegation's DS
   RRset accordingly.

   This document specifies that when performing such queries, parent-
   side entities MUST ensure that updates triggered via CDS/CDNSKEY and
   CSYNC records are consistent across the child's authoritative
   nameservers, before taking any action based on these records.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC7344] automates DNSSEC delegation trust maintenance by having the
   child publish CDS and/or CDNSKEY records which hold the prospective
   DS parameters.  Similarly, [RFC7477] specifies CSYNC records
   indicating a desired update of the delegation's NS and associated
   glue records.  Parent-side entities (e.g.  Registries, Registrars)
   can use these records to update the corresponding records of the
   delegation.

   A common method for discovering these signals is to periodically
   query them from the child zone ("polling").  For CSYNC, this is
   described in [RFC7477] Section 3.1 which advocates limiting queries
   to just one authoritative nameserver.  The corresponding Section 6.1
   of [RFC7344] (CDS/CDNSKEY) contains no such provision for how
   specifically polling of these records should be done.

   Implementations are thus likely to retrieve records from just one
   authoritative server, typically by directing queries towards a
   trusted validating resolver.  While that may be fine if all
   authoritative nameservers are controlled by the same entity
   (typically the Child DNS Operator), it does pose a problem as soon as
   multiple providers are involved.  (Note that it is generally
   impossible for the parent to determine whether all authoritative
   nameservers are controlled by the same entity.)

   In such cases, CDS/CDNSKEY/CSYNC records retrieved "naively" from one
   nameserver only may be entirely inconsistent with those of other
   authoritative servers.  When no consistency check is done, each
   provider may unilaterally trigger a roll of the DS or NS record set
   at the parent.

   As a result, adverse consequences can arise in conjunction with the
   multi-signer scenarios laid out in [RFC8901], both when deployed
   temporarily (during a provider change) and permanently (in a multi-
   homing setup).  For example, a single provider may (accidentally or
   maliciously) cause another provider's trust anchors and/or
   nameservers to be removed from the delegation.  Similar breakage can
   occur when the delegation has lame nameservers.  More detailed
   examples are given in Appendix A.

   A single provider should not be in the position to remove the other
   providers' records from the delegation.  To address this issue, this
   document specifies that parent-side entities MUST ensure that the
   updates indicated by CDS/CDNSKEY and CSYNC record sets are consistent
   across all of the child's authoritative nameservers, before taking
   any action based on these records.

   Readers are expected to be familiar with DNSSEC, including [RFC4033],
   [RFC4034], [RFC4035], [RFC6781], [RFC7344], [RFC7477], and [RFC8901].

2.  Processing Requirements

   This section defines consistency requirements for CDS/CDNSKEY/CSYNC
   queries in the context of automatic delegation maintenance, updating
   [RFC7344] Section 4.1 and [RFC7477] Sections 3.1 and 4.2.  Common
   ones are listed first, with type-specific consistency criteria
   described in each subsection.

   In all cases, consistency is REQUIRED across received responses only.
   When a response cannot be obtained from a given nameserver, the
   Parental Agent SHOULD attempt obtaining it at a later time, before
   concluding that the nameserver is permanently unreachable and
   removing it from consideration.  A retry schedule with exponential
   back-off is RECOMMENDED (such as after 5, 10, 20, 40, ... minutes).
   To sidestep localized routing issues, the Parental Agent MAY also
   attempt contacting the nameserver from another vantage point.

   If an inconsistent state is encountered, the Parental Agent MUST
   abort the operation.  Specifically, it MUST NOT delete or alter any
   existing RRset that would have been deleted or altered, and MUST NOT
   create any RRsets that would have been created, had the polling state
   been consistent.

   To accommodate transient inconsistencies (e.g. replication delays),
   the Parental Agent MAY retry the full process, repeating all queries.
   A schedule with exponential back-off is RECOMMENDED.

   Any pending queries can immediately be dequeued when encountering a
   response that confirms the status quo (i.e. indicates no update).
   This is because any subsequent responses could only confirm that
   nothing needs to happen, or give an inconsistent result in which case
   nothing needs to happen.  Queries MAY be continued across all
   nameservers for inconsistency reporting purposes.

   Existing requirements for ensuring integrity remain in effect.  In
   particular, DNSSEC signatures MUST be requested and validated for all
   queries unless otherwise noted.

2.1.  CDS and CDNSKEY

   To retrieve a Child's CDS/CDNSKEY RRset for DNSSEC delegation trust
   maintenance, the Parental Agent, knowing both the Child zone name and
   its NS hostnames, MUST ascertain that queries are made against all
   (reachable) nameservers listed in the Child's delegation from the
   Parent, and ensure that each key referenced in any of the received
   answers is also referenced in all other received responses.

   In other words, CDS/CDNSKEY records at the Child zone apex MUST be
   fetched directly from each (reachable) authoritative server as
   determined by the delegation's NS record set.  When a key is
   referenced in a CDS or CDNSKEY record set returned by one nameserver,
   but is missing from a least one other nameserver's answer, the CDS/
   CDNSKEY state MUST be considered inconsistent.

   When CDS/CDNSKEY queries are performed for deploying the initial DS
   record set (DNSSEC bootstrapping), responses cannot be directly
   validated.  In this case, integrity checks according to [RFC8078]
   Section 3 (or its successors) continue to apply.

2.2.  CSYNC

   A CSYNC-based update consists of (1) querying the CSYNC (and possibly
   SOA) record to determine which data records shall be synchronized
   from child to parent; (2) querying for these data records (e.g.  NS)
   and placing them in the parent zone.  If the below conditions are not
   met during these steps, the CSYNC state MUST be considered
   inconsistent.

   When querying the CYSNC record, the Parental Agent MUST ascertain
   that queries are made against all (reachable) nameservers listed in
   the Child's delegation from the Parent, and ensure that the record's
   immediate flag and type bitmap are equal across received responses.

   The CSYNC record's SOA serial field and soaminimum flag might
   legitimately differ across nameservers (such as in multi-provider
   setups); equality is thus not required across responses.  Instead,
   for a given response, processing of these values thus MUST occur with
   respect to the SOA record as obtained from the same nameserver
   (preferably in the same connection).  The resulting per-response
   assessments of whether the CSYNC update is permissible MUST match
   across received responses.

   Further, when retrieving the data record sets as indicated in the
   CSYNC record (such as NS or A/AAAA records), the Parental Agent MUST
   ascertain that all queries are made against all nameservers from
   which CSYNC responses were received (preferably in the same
   connection), and ensure that all return responses with equal rdata
   sets (including all empty).

   CSYNC updates may cause validation or even insecure resolution to
   break (e.g. by changing the delegation to a set of nameservers that
   do not serve required DNSKEY records or do not know the zone at all).
   Parental Agents SHOULD check that CSYNC updates, if applied, do not
   break the delegation.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

4.  Security Considerations

   The level of rigor mandated by this document is needed to prevent
   publication of half-baked DS or delegation NS RRsets (authorized only
   under an insufficient subset of authoritative nameservers), ensuring
   that an operator in a (functioning) multi-homing setup cannot
   unilaterally modify the delegation (add or remove trust anchors or
   nameservers).  This applies both to intentional and unintentional
   multi-homing setups (such as in the case of lame delegation
   hijacking).

   As a consequence, the delegation's records can only be modified when
   there is consensus across operators, which is expected to reflect the
   domain owner's intentions.  Both availability and integrity of the
   domain's DNS service benefit from this policy.

   In order to resolve situations in which consensus about child zone
   contents cannot be reached (e.g. because one of the nameserver
   providers is uncooperative), Parental Agents SHOULD continue to
   accept DS and NS/glue update requests from the domain owner via an
   authenticated out-of-band channel (such as EPP [RFC5730]),
   irrespective of the rise of automated delegation maintenance.
   Availability of such an interface also enables recovery from a
   situation where the private key is no longer available for signing
   the CDS/CDNSKEY or CSYNC records in the child zone.

Appendix A.  Failure Scenarios

   The following scenarios are examples of how things can go wrong when
   consistency is not enforced by the parent during CDS/CDNSKEY/CSYNC
   processing.  Other scenarios that cause similar (or perhaps even
   more) harm may exist.

   The common feature of these scenarios is that if one nameserver steps
   out of line and the parent is not careful, DNS resolution and/or
   validation will break down.  When several DNS providers are involved,
   this undermines the very guarantees of operator independence that
   multi-homing configurations are expected to provide.

A.1.  DS Breakage due to Replication Lag

   If an authoritative nameserver is lagging behind during a key
   rollover, the parent may see different CDS/CDNSKEY RRsets depending
   on the nameserver contacted.  This may cause old and new DS RRsets to
   be deployed in an alternating fashion.  The zone maintainer, having
   detected that the DS deployment was successful, may then confidently
   remove the old DNSKEY from the zonefile, only to find out later that
   the DS RRset has been turned back, breaking the delegation's DNSSEC
   chain of trust.

   Checking for consistency minimizes this risk.  In case the parent
   reports consistency errors downstream, it can also help detect the
   replication issue on the child side.

A.2.  Lame Delegations

   A delegation may include a non-existent NS hostname, for example due
   to a typo or when the nameserver's domain registration has expired.
   (Re-)registering such a non-resolvable nameserver domain allows a
   third party to run authoritative DNS service for all domains
   delegated to that NS hostname, serving responses different from those
   in the legitimate zonefile.

   This strategy for hijacking (at least part of the) DNS traffic and
   spoofing responses is not new, but surprisingly common
   [LAME1][LAME2].  It is also known that DNSSEC reduces the impact of
   such an attack, as validating resolvers will reject illegitimate
   responses due to lack of signatures consistent with the delegation's
   DS records.

Internet-Draft               cds-consistency              September 2023


   On the other hand, if the delegation is not protected by DNSSEC, the
   rogue nameserver is not only able to serve unauthorized responses
   without detection; it is even possible for the attacker to escalate
   the nameserver takeover to a full domain takeover.

   In particular, the rogue nameserver can publish CDS/CDNSKEY records.
   If those are processed by the parent without ensuring consistency
   with other authoritative nameservers, the delegation will be secured
   with the attacker's DNSSEC keys.  As responses served by the
   remaining legitimate nameservers are not signed with these keys,
   validating resolvers will start rejecting them.

   Once DNSSEC is established, the attacker can use CSYNC to remove
   other nameservers from the delegation at will (and potentially add
   new ones under their control).  This enables the attacker to position
   themself as the only party providing authoritiative DNS service for
   the victim domain, significantly augmenting the attack's impact.

A.3.  Multi-Homing (Permanent Multi-Signer)

A.3.1.  DS Breakage

   While performing a key rollover and adjusting the corresponding CDS/
   CDNSKEY records, a provider could accidentally publish CDS/CDNSKEY
   records that only include its own keys.

   When the parent happens to retrieve the records from a nameserver
   controlled by this provider, the other providers' DS records would be
   removed from the delegation.  As a result, the zone is broken at
   least for some queries.

A.3.2.  NS Breakage

   A similar scenario affects the CSYNC record, which is used to update
   the delegation's NS record set at the parent.  The issue occurs, for
   example, when a provider accidentally includes only their own set of
   hostnames in the local NS record set, or publishes an otherwise
   flawed NS record set.

   If the parent then observes a CSYNC signal and fetches the flawed NS
   record set without ensuring consistency across nameservers, the
   delegation may be updated in a way that breaks resolution or silently
   reduces the multi-homing setup to a single-provider setup.

A.4.  Provider Change (Temporary Multi-Signer)

   Transferring DNS service for a domain name from one (signing) DNS
   provider to another, without going insecure, necessitates a brief
   period during which the domain is operated in multi-signer mode:
   First, the providers include each other's signing keys as DNSKEY and
   CDS/CDNSKEY records in their copy of the zone.  Once the parent
   detects the updated CDS/CDNSKEY record set at the old provider, the
   delegation's DS record set is updated.  Then, after waiting for cache
   expiration, the new provider's NS hostnames can be added to the
   zone's NS record set, so that queries start balancing across both
   providers.  (To conclude the hand-over, the old provider is removed
   by inverting these steps with swapped roles.)

   The multi-signer phase of this process breaks when the new provider,
   perhaps unaware of the situation and its intricacies, fails to
   include the old provider's keys in the DNSKEY (and CDS/CDNSKEY)
   record sets.  One obvious consequence of that is that whenever the
   resolver happens to retrieve the DNSKEY record set from the new
   provider, the old provider's RRSIGs do no longer validate, causing
   SERVFAIL to be returned.

   However, an even worse consequence can occur when the parent performs
   their next CDS/CDNSKEY scan: It may then happen that the incorrect
   CDS/CDNSKEY record set is fetched from the new provider and used to
   update the delegation's DS record set.  As a result, the old provider
   (who still appears in the delegation) is prematurely removed from the
   domain's DNSSEC chain of trust.  The new DS record set authenticates
   the new provider's DNSKEYs only, and DNSSEC validation fails for all
   answers served by the old provider.
