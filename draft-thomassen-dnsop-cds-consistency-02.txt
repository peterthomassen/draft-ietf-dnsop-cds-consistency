           Consistency for CDS/CDNSKEY and CSYNC is Mandatory
                draft-thomassen-dnsop-cds-consistency-02

Abstract

   Maintenance of DNS delegations requires occasional changes of the DS
   and NS record sets on the parent side of the delegation.  [RFC7344]
   automates this for DS records by having the child publish CDS and/or
   CDNSKEY records which hold the prospective DS parameters.  Similarly,
   CSYNC records indicate a desired update of the delegation's NS
   records [RFC7477].  Parent-side entities (e.g.  Registries,
   Registrars) typically discover these records by periodically querying
   them from the child ("polling"), before using them to update the
   delegation's parameters.

   This document specifies that if polling is used, parent-side entities
   MUST ensure that updates triggered via CDS/CDNSKEY and CSYNC records
   are consistent across the child's authoritative nameservers, before
   taking any action based on these records.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC7344] automates DNSSEC delegation trust maintenance by having the
   child publish CDS and/or CDNSKEY records which hold the prospective
   DS parameters.  Similarly, [RFC7477] specifies CSYNC records
   indicating a desired update of the delegation's NS records.  Parent-
   side entities (e.g.  Registries, Registrars) can use these records to
   update the delegation's DS and NS records.

   A common method for discovering these signals is to periodically
   query them from the child zone ("polling"), as described in
   Section 6.1 of [RFC7344] (CDS/CDNSKEY) and Section 3.1 of [RFC7477]
   (CSYNC).

   While [RFC7344] does specify acceptance rules (Section 4.1) for CDS/
   CDNSKEY records that have been retrieved, it does not mention how
   specifically the poll queries should be done.  For CSYNC, [RFC7477]
   leaves it up to the parent to decide from how many nameservers the
   records are retrieved (Section 4.2).  A naive implementation would
   thus be likely to retrieve records from just one authoritative
   server, possibly by directing queries towards a trusted validating
   resolver.

   This may be fine if all authoritative nameservers are controlled by
   the same entity (typically the DNS operator).  However, it poses a
   problem in conjunction with the multi-signer scenarios laid out in
   [RFC8901], both when deployed temporarily (during a provider change)
   or permanently (in a multi-homing setup).

   CDS/CDNSKEY/CSYNC records retrieved "naively" from one nameserver
   only may be entirely inconsistent with those of other authoritative
   servers.  When several providers are configured and no consistency
   check is done, a single provider could (accidentally or maliciously)
   roll the DS or NS record set at the parent and, for example, remove
   the other provider's trust anchors and/or nameservers from the
   delegation.  More detailed examples are given in Section 2.

   Whether in a permanent multi-homing setup or during provider change:
   A single provider should not be in the position to remove the other
   providers' records from the delegation.

   To address this issue, this document specifies that if polling is
   used, parent-side entities MUST ensure that the updates indicated by
   CDS/CDNSKEY and CSYNC record sets are consistent across all of the
   child's authoritative nameservers, before taking any action based on
   these records.

   Readers are expected to be familiar with DNSSEC, including [RFC4033],
   [RFC4034], [RFC4035], [RFC6781], [RFC7344], [RFC7477], and [RFC8901].

2.  Failure Scenarios

   The following scenarios are examples of how things can go wrong when
   consistency is not enforced by the parent during CDS/CDNSKEY/CSYNC
   processing.  Other scenarios that cause similar (or perhaps even
   more) harm may exist.

   The common feature of these scenarios is that if one DNS provider
   makes a mistake and the parent is not careful, DNS resolution and/or
   validation will break down, undermining the very guarantees of
   operator independence that DNSSEC multi-signer models are intended to
   provide.

2.1.  Multi-Homing (Permanent Multi-Signer)

2.1.1.  DS Breakage

   While performing a key rollover and adjusting the corresponding CDS/
   CDNSKEY records, a provider could accidentally publish CDS/CDNSKEY
   records that only include its own keys.

   When the parent happens to retrieve the records from a nameserver
   controlled by this provider, the other providers' DS records would be
   removed from the parent.  As a result, the zone is broken at least
   for some queries.

2.1.2.  NS Breakage

   A similar scenario affects the CSYNC record, which is used to update
   the delegation's NS record set at the parent.  The issue occurs, for
   example, when a provider accidentally includes only their own set of
   hostnames in the local NS record set, or publishes an otherwise
   flawed NS record set.

   If the parent then observes a CSYNC signal and fetches the flawed NS
   record set without ensuring consistency across nameservers, the
   delegation may be updated so that resolution is broken, or the multi-
   homing setup is silently reduced to a single-provider setup.

2.2.  Provider Change (Temporary Multi-Signer)

   Transferring a domain from one (signing) DNS provider to another,
   without going insecure, necessitates a brief period during which the
   domain is operated in multi-signer mode: First, the providers include
   each other's signing keys as DNSKEY and CDS/CDNSKEY records in their
   copy of the zone.  Once the parent detects the updated CDS/CDNSKEY
   record set at the old provider, the delegation's DS record set is
   updated.  Then, after waiting for cache expiration, the new



Thomassen                 Expires 23 April 2023                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft               cds-consistency                October 2022


   provider's NS hostnames can be added to the zone's NS record set, so
   that queries start balancing across both providers.  (To conclude the
   hand-over, the old provider is removed by inverting these steps with
   swapped roles.)

   The multi-signer phase of this process breaks when the new provider
   fails to include the old provider's keys in the DNSKEY and CDS/
   CDNSKEY record sets.  One obvious consequence of that is that
   whenever the resolver happens to retrieve the DNKSEY record set from
   the new provider, the old provider's RRSIGs do no longer validate,
   causing to SERVFAIL responses.

   However, an even worse consequence can occur when the parent performs
   their next CDS/CDNSKEY scan: It may then happen that the incorrect
   CDS/CDNSKEY record set is fetched from the new provider and used to
   update the delegation's DS record set.  As a result, the old provider
   is prematureley removed from the domain's DNSSEC chain of trust.  The
   new DS record set authenticates the new provider's DNSKEYs only, and
   DNSSEC validation fails for all answers served by the old provider.

3.  Performing a Poll-based CDS or CDNSKEY Update

   The terminology in this section is as defined in [RFC7344].

   To retrieve a Child's CDS/CDNSKEY RRset for DNSSEC delegation trust
   maintenance, the Parental Agent, knowing both the Child zone name and
   its NS hostnames, MUST ascertain that queries are made against all of
   the nameservers listed in the Child's delegation from the Parent, and
   ensure that each key referenced in any of the non-empty answers is
   also referenced in all other non-empty answers.

   In other words, CDS/CDNSKEY records at the Child zone apex MUST be
   fetched directly from each of the authoritative servers as determined
   by the delegation's NS record set, with DNSSEC validation enforced.
   When a key is referenced in a CDS or CDNSKEY record set returned by
   one nameserver, but is missing from a least one other nameserver's
   non-empty answer, the CDS/CDNSKEY state MUST be considered
   inconsistent.

   Consistency is only REQUIRED across non-empty answers: Nameservers
   that provide valid proof of non-existence or do not respond SHOULD be
   disregarded.

   If an inconsistent CDS/CDNSKEY state is encountered, the Parental
   Agent MUST take no action.  Specifically, it MUST NOT delete or alter
   the existing DS RRset.

4.  Performing a Poll-based CSYNC Update

   A CSYNC-based update consists of (1) polling the CSYNC record to
   determine which data records shall be synchronized from child to
   parent; (2) querying for these data records (e.g.  NS) and placing
   them in the parent zone.  Both steps are described separately below.

   If an inconsistent CSYNC state is encountered in the process, the
   Parental Agent MUST take no action.  Specifically, it MUST NOT delete
   or alter any existing NS or other data RRset.

4.1.  Querying for CSYNC

   When retrieving CYSNC record sets, the Parental Agent MUST ascertain
   that queries are made against all of the nameservers listed in the
   Child's delegation from the Parent, and ensure that the CSYNC record
   sets are equal across all non-empty answers.  Otherwise, the CSYNC
   state MUST be considered inconsistent.

   For CSYNC queries, consistency is only REQUIRED across non-empty
   answers: Nameservers that provide valid proof of non-existence or do
   not respond SHOULD be disregarded.  (This is like for CDS/CDNSKEY
   queries above.)

4.2.  Querying for Data Records (e.g.  NS)

   When retrieving data records (e.g.  NS), the Parental Agent MUST
   ascertain that all queries are made against all of the nameservers
   listed in the Child's delegation from the Parent, and ensure that all
   answers received are equal.  Otherwise, the CSYNC state MUST be
   considered inconsistent.

   Unlike for CSYNC queries, answers MUST be all non-empty and equal, or
   all empty.  Unresponsive nameservers SHOULD be disregarded.  If both
   an empty and a non-empty answer is received for a data record query,
   the state MUST be considered inconsistent.

5.  Security Considerations

   The level of rigor mandated by this document is needed to prevent
   publication of a half-baked DS or NS RRsets (authorized only under an
   insufficient subset of authoritative nameservers).  This ensures, for
   example, that an operator in a multi-homed setup cannot unilaterally
   remove another operator's trust anchor or nameservers from the
   delegation.

   As a consequence, the delegation's records can only be modified when
   there is consensus across operators.
